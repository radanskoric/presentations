            Let's dive a bit into the early days of the software development.
            The common approach to software development back then was the waterfall model.

            For those of you not familiar with it, it consists of two key concepts.

            One is the Big Requirements Up Front approach that says that all of the requirements of
            the project should be identified and documented up front in a comprehensive document.

            The project then proceeds through these distinct phases of the project where each phase is
            fully completed before proceeding to the next phase.

            However there is one big problem with approach.

            Anyone wnat to take a guess at what's the biggest problem with it? *ask the audience*

            Maybe this sounds familiar:

            You deploy a test version for the client and they tell you
            that they have a great a idea how to make the whole thing
            much better ... you just have to change, you know, everything.

            OR, even worse

            You deploy a test version and the client tells you that this
            is not what they were expecting.

          <h2>2001, Snowbird, Utah</h2>

          <h3>17 Software development experts</h3>
          <h3>The birth of the <i>Agile Manifesto</i></h3>

          <aside class="notes">
            17 experienced software developers got together in February of 2001 in
            Snowbird ski resort in Utah to ski, eat and discuss these very problems.

            They were all representatives of various software development approaches
            that will later come to be referred as Agile methodologies. So, the funny
            thing is that all of these methodologies that we today regard as flavours
            of Agile are actually older than the term Agile itself.

            And the main reason is that back then in Snowbird they managed to find common
            ground between all of the methodologies and compile it into the Agile Manifesto.

          <aside class="notes">
            Note the emphasis is on lessons learned through experience
            developing software projects rather trying to think their

          <aside class="notes">
            This point is primarily about the fact that software is developed
            by humans and humans work like humans, not like robots.

          <aside class="notes">
            Sprint is the basic unit of Scrum. It is a timeboxed effort that aims to
            deliver the next iteration of the working software at the end of it. It
            is usually between 1 week and 1 month long with 2 weeks being the most common.

            It starts with Sprint planning which consists of two phases. In the first timeboxed
            phase the whole team works to identify items from the higher level product backlog
            that could be delivered in this sprint. In the second phase the team works to break
            it down into smaller tickets that are then estimated and form the Sprint backlog.

            At the end of the sprint working, and only working, features are demoed for the
            stakeholders during the Sprint Review.

            After the Review the team holds a restrospective where they discuss what went wall and
            what went wrong during the sprint and how they can improve.

            The last value, responding to change over following a plan is maybe the most important one.

            And we can examine how it can naturally lead us to the basic principle of Scrum.

          <h2>Other agile methodologies</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">Kanban</li>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Scrumban</li>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Extreme programming</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            Kanban is a method that focuses on the continuous flow and elimination of bottlenecks.
            There are no sprints, the team focuses on the things that are in progress and
            when done it pulls from the top of the backlog which the product owner is free
            to reprioritise to keep the most important items on the top. A key component is WIP limit
            prevent accumulation of partially finished work.

            Scrumban, as the name suggest tries to borrow from both Scrum and Kanban and then adds a bit
            of its own into the mix. Roughly speaking, from Scrum it takes sprints but has them in variable length and sprint planning is triggered when number of planned tickets becomes too low.
            From Kanban it takes WIP limits to ensure an efficient flow.

            Extreme programming is on the surface very similar to Scrum, it also has planned sprints.
            It is different is a number of subtle ways which I won't get into now. Perhaps the biggest
            difference is that XP prescribes engineering practices like TDD and Pair programming while
            Scrum doesn't. However XP practices are usable in almost any Agile methodology.

          <h2>Importance of culture</h2>
          <ol>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0">All together</li>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Shared success</li>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Chicken vs Pig</li>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Valuable work</li>
          </ol>

          <aside class="notes">
            Quite often you might hear that people tried to implement Agile,
            followed the practices to the letter but failed.

            The first place to look for a culprit is the culture. Company and team culture.

            The most important thing to adopt is the notion that everyone is working together.
            Great team work is of paramount importance to get Agile right.

            That implies that there has to be a notion of shared success. If one developer
            finishes their tasks on time but the feature is not finished because another
            didn't finish his then there is no value delivered. It might have been better if the first
            developer first helped the other finish their task. An extreme example is how a
            CEO, if he can't help in any other way than by bringing coffee to the developers then the
            best thing he can do for the project is to go make some coffee.

            The concept of a Chicken and a Pig is sometimes used. It comes from an anecdote about
            Chicken telling a Pig that they should open a restaurant together. Pig asks what would
            it be called. "Ham and eggs" says the chicken. The pig answers "No thanks, I'd be committed but
            you'd be only invested." It is important for all of the team members to feel like Pigs, committed
            into the project. People on the outside that provide valuable insight, like users or beta testers, are chickens, invested but not committed.

            And the only way for people to get that sense intrinsically is to draw pleasure from their
            work and the best way for it is to see clearly the value you create from your work.
            That is another reason why all Agile methodologies put so much emphasis on Value, their
            rapid delivery and putting developers in contact with the stakeholders who's lives they
            improve.
